# Google Spreadsheet DHT Sensor Data-logging Example

# Depends on the 'gspread' and 'oauth2client' package being installed.  If you
# have pip installed execute:
#   sudo pip install gspread oauth2client

# Also it's _very important_ on the Raspberry Pi to install the python-openssl
# package because the version of Python is a bit old and can fail with Google's
# new OAuth2 based authentication.  Run the following command to install the
# the package:
#   sudo apt-get update
#   sudo apt-get install python-openssl

# Google Docs OAuth credential JSON file.  Note that the process for authenticating
# with Google docs has changed as of ~April 2015.  You _must_ use OAuth2 to log
# in and authenticate with the gspread library.  Unfortunately this process is much
# more complicated than the old process.  You _must_ carefully follow the steps on
# this page to create a new OAuth service in your Google developer console:
#   http://gspread.readthedocs.org/en/latest/oauth2.html
#
# Once you've followed the steps above you should have downloaded a .json file with
# your OAuth2 credentials.  This file has a name like SpreadsheetData-<gibberish>.json.
# Place that file in the same directory as this python script.
#
# Now one last _very important_ step before updating the spreadsheet will work.
# Go to your spreadsheet in Google Spreadsheet and share it to the email address
# inside the 'client_email' setting in the SpreadsheetData-*.json file.  For example
# if the client_email setting inside the .json file has an email address like:
#   149345334675-md0qff5f0kib41meu20f7d1habos3qcu@developer.gserviceaccount.com
# Then use the File -> Share... command in the spreadsheet to share it with read
# and write acess to the email address above.  If you don't do this step then the
# updates to the sheet will fail!
